# Rick's Personal Website
September 2018 Front End Web Development Project

Rick needed a website that he could use to share his interests and connect with like-minded people.

# Custom CSS Classes

Some classes I created are:

1. ( img[src$=".png"] )
It is supposed to make all images with the file type ".png" as the same size.

2. ( a, a:hover, a:visited )
I created these for the text "DopyJr" could be more interactive and the user would know it was an actionable item.

3. ( header::before )
This calls an image before the header tag so that you are supposed to get layering of content into a single area.

# Custom JavaScript Functions

The javascript function I created are:

1. function randomNumber(upper)
The function is supposed to generate a random number and write his game ranking.
